# Judging-a-book-by-its-cover

Problem : Given a dataset consisting of book cover images and book titles, the goal was to predict the genre of books (e.g., Law, Romance, etc.)

Dataset: The training data consists of around 34K cover images and book titles, with a total 
of 30 classes. The data is almost balanced, meaning each class proportion is almost similar. 
The test data has around 11k cover images and book titles distributed equally among each 
class. 

Model: Implemented different models like CNN with images, CNN with text , LSTM with images and transfomers model. Reached an accuracy of around 62% from 18% using transformers model.
